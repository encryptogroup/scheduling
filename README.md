# Privacy-Preserving Event Scheduling
Privacy-preserving event scheduling system

By *√Ågnes Kiss*, *Oliver Schick* and *Thomas Schneider* ([ENCRYPTO](http://www.encrypto.de), TU Darmstadt) in [SECRYPT'19](http://www.secrypt.icete.org/). Paper available [here](http://encrypto.de/papers/KSS19.pdf).

### Features
---

Our implementation for privacy-preserving event scheduling is based on secure computation, more specifically, on the ABY framework (https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY).

This code is provided as a experimental implementation for testing purposes and should not be used in a productive environment. We cannot guarantee security and correctness.

### Requirements
---
The requirements are the same as that of https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY and you need to install Node.js for the web application by running
```
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
